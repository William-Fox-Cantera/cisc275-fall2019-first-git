1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	- An ArrayList of Dogs
	- Three dogs --> Fido, Fido, and Alfie
	- A comparator object

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	- The constructor call is on the line where Collections.sort is called.
	  the new keyword is used so its constructor is called.

	- The class definition for comparator is in the imported file java.util.Comparator.
	  which is in the util package.
